              	<p>The TAL Nepal Strategy and Action Plan (2015-2025) was endorsed by the government of Nepal to guide the implementation of the TAL vision for the next ten-year period. WWF Nepal provided technical support for the preparation of the strategy and action plan. The new plan included an extension of about 4,518km2 area of important climate refugia in the northern part of TAL. Its precursor, the TAL Strategic Plan and Implementation Plan (2004-14), had identified thematic areas and major interventions, and a business plan for the conservation of the landscape and sustainable livelihoods of local communities. The government’s Ministry of Forests and Soil Conservation and WWF Nepal are jointly implementing two projects – Corridors and Bottlenecks Restoration Project and Protected Area and Buffer Zone Support Project – based on the strategic direction of these seminal documents.</p>
