                <p>A total of 2,500 biogas units were installed during this fiscal year contributing to the target of 20,000 units under the second phase of the Gold Standard Biogas Verification Emission Reduction (VER) Project (2013-2020) with 8,750 installed since its start. WWF Nepal completed its first Gold Standard Biogas VER project in the Terai Arc Landscape in 2015. The first vantage of carbon credits from the first phasegenerated â‚¬2 million. This is being channeled back to the local communities for building additional biogas units as well as funding community development programs. Biogas as an alternate energy source is helping replace household demand for firewood particularly in the Terai. This is reducing pressure on forest resources and contributing to the health of local communities through a smoke-free and cleaner energy alternative.</p>
