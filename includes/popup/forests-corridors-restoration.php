                <p>Restoration of degraded areas is a key intervention to maintain critical connectivity between parks and reserves for wildlife. The restoration activities are led by local communities in corridor forests in order to provide suitable pathways for wildlife to move freely between protected areas through the corridor forests. During this fiscal year, local communities restored 334ha of degraded forests and 16 water holes. Community nurseries were supported to produce 574,000 seedlings in TAL and 40,400 seedlings in SHL to aid the restoration efforts. The local communities also rehabilitated 152ha of encroached forest areas in TAL with the support of the District Forest Office. In SHL, 3,000 seedlings were planted along the Syafrubesi-Rasuwagadi highway and trade route which is being promoted as a green economic corridor between Nepal and China.</p>
