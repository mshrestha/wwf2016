                <p>Five one-horned rhinos found a new home in Bardia National Park through a successful translocation expedition from Chitwan National Park in Nepalâ€™s Terai Arc Landscape (TAL) on 1-5 March 2016. The translocation is part of a larger effort to move 30 rhinos to Bardia National Park and Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve through 2018. The expedition is an important step towards creating a second viable population in the western complex of TAL with the broader goal of bringing back rhino populations to its historic level of 800+. As an encouraging development post-translocation, a male calf was born to a translocated female rhino on 22 May 2016.</p>
