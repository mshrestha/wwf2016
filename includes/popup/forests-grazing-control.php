                <p>TAL is home to more than 7 million people with more than 5 million livestock providing for their livelihoods needs. Uncontrolled grazing of livestock in community and buffer zone forests is, in effect, a primary driver of forest degradation. Considering the need to better manage livestock and grazing practices for the benefit of biodiversity conservation, local communities have initiated several programs centered on declaring zero grazing zones, stall feeding, distribution of fodder seedlings and fencing. 25,000 grass and fodder seedlings were distributed to local household for plantation in private lands so as to provide for the fodder needs of livestock, while 1,380 households were provided with cement troughs as an alternate to the wooden troughs used by local households for feeding livestock. Three zero grazing zones have been declared in TAL till date as a major initiative to build community support for responsible grazing practices.</p>
