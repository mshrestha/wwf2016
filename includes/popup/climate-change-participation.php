				<h1 class="uppercase">Participation in the UNFCCC Process</h1>
				<p>WWF Nepal participated in the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP21 held in Paris, France, from 30 November to 12 December 2015, which marked the 21st yearly session of the Conference of the Parties to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The conference negotiated the Paris Agreement, a global agreement on the reduction of climate change. The agreement will enter into force when joined by at least 55 countries which together represent at least 55% of global greenhouse emissions. On 22 April 2016 (Earth Day), 174 countries, including Nepal, signed the agreement. Post COP 21, the government of Nepal submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), which identified the role of REDD+ for climate change mitigation. WWF Nepal, as a team member, supported the government in drafting the INDCs.</p>
