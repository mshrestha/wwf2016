				<p>The tiger is iconic of Asia’s natural heritage and ecological integrity, and has wide cultural esteem. Unfortunately, due to extensive habitat loss and intensive poaching for their body parts, tiger populations across the range have shrunk alarmingly over the past five decades. Today tigers occupy a mere 7% of their historic range. WWF, recognizing that a wider paradigm shift is required if Asia’s top predator is to survive the next decade and beyond, is working to protect the tiger through its ambitious network-wide Tigers Alive Initiative (TAI). The TAI team proposes a bold plan to galvanize political will and take action to double the number of wild tigers by the year 2022, focusing on 13 tiger landscapes in the 13 tiger range countries. The Government of Nepal has shown exceptional commitment to TX2 and is working with WWF Nepal and its conservation partners to achieve the same.</p>
