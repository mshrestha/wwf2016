				<p>Climate adaptation interventions were supported through the formulation and implementation of Community Adaptation Plans of Action (CAPA) in vulnerable sites and Local Adaptation Plan for Action (LAPA) at the Village Development Committee level. An estimated 3,500 households benefitted from key adaptation interventions comprising of farmersâ€™ schools, off-season cash crop farming, small irrigation support, construction of conservation ponds and water source protection to improve water availability for household use and irrigation. Plantations, check dams and bio-engineering for slope stabilization around vulnerable sites further helped protect forests and agricultural lands from inundation, landslides and river-bank cutting.</p>
