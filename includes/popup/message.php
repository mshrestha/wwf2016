                                <p>We cannot look forward without looking back.</p>	    			
                                <p>The past fiscal year marks a decade since WWF Nepal embarked on its journey onward under a new leadership, heavy with the loss of our conservation stalwarts from the tragic helicopter accident of 23 September 2006. This was also the time when Nepal was just coming out of the Maoist insurgency, which had fueled insecurity for the nation and years of conservation effort.</p>
                                <p>But onward we went. And in these changing times, if there was one constant that the WWF Nepal Program held on to, it was hope – hope and a spirit that will not allow us to give up on what we started.</p>
                                <p>We close a decade with the past fiscal year, which has further helped us build on our conservation promise. We are working towards creating a second viable population of rhinos in the western complex of the Terai Arc Landscape through a successful resumption of rhino translocations from Chitwan National Park. We were successful in celebrating two consecutive years of zero poaching of rhinos for the first time in Nepal, and probably in the world. Nepal’s forest cover has increased by 5%; successful forest restoration and protection programs, including the country’s far-reaching community forestry program, are the primary reasons behind this conservation impact with over 3,600ha of additional forests handed over to local communities in the last fiscal year alone. The government endorsement of the new landscape level strategies for the Terai Arc Landscape and Chitwan-Annapurna Landscape builds on our conservation ambition and will provide new impetus to conservation over the next ten-year period, while its commitment to ratify the Paris Agreement will help pave the roadmap for Nepal’s to further engage to build adaptive capacities of communities and ecosystems and enhance low carbon development. And we continued our work with the local communities, building resilience to the impacts of climate change while improving access to water resources, and strengthening capacity in natural resource management and undertaking conservation research while helping establish sustainable communities for conservation.</p>
                                <p>The coming fiscal year marks the start of our new strategic direction to guide our goals for the next five years with our key focus on building the WWF Nepal program as a centre of excellence and a sustainable office all made possible through the power of partnerships. I thank the government of Nepal for considering us a trusted partner in conservation, and deeply acknowledge the support from the WWF Network, local communities and conservation partners.</p>
                                <p>Here’s to hope and our indefatigable conservation spirit!</p>
