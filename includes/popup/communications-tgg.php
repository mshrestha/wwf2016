				<h1 class="uppercase">THE GENERATION GREEN</h1>
				<p>A total of 55,000 youth signed up to WWF Nepal’s The Generation Green (TGG) campaign. The campaign, which seeks to build youth voice and action for the environment and Nepal’s sustainable development, has a target of creating 500,000 youth members. The mentorship program, one of the flagship projects of TGG campaign engaged 14 leading Nepali citizens as mentors and 77 selected TGG members who conceptualized and implemented a total of 14 projects focusing on open space management, recycling arts and crafts products, conservation research and environment education. Seed Your Future (SYF), yet another key initiative under the campaign, was launched with ten schools as a pilot where students undertook small-scale organic farming within their schools. Market linkages were established to showcase their first monsoon harvest in a local farmer’s market. The campaign aims to make a continuous effort in educating and empowering youth with various engaging platforms and inculcating the concept of sustainable living in Nepal’s future youth leaders.</p>
