	    				<p>The mentorship program, one of the flagship projects of WWF Nepal’s The Generation Green (TGG) campaign engaged 14 leading Nepali citizens from different sectors as mentors and 77 selected TGG members spent a period of six months conceptualizing and implementing their project under the respective mentor. A total of 14 projects focusing on open space management, recycling arts and crafts products, energy conservation study and environment education were carried out. Seed Your Future (SYF), yet another key initiative under the campaign was launched as a drive towards personal social responsibility by motivating young people to take a simple single step towards protecting the environment. Ten schools were selected as a pilot project of SYF and through poly-houses constructed in each school, students grew vegetables and greens. Market linkages were established to showcase their first monsoon harvest of the season in July in a local farmer’s market. The campaign aims to make a continuous effort in educating and empowering youth with various engaging platforms and inculcating the concept of sustainable living in future youth leaders.</p>
