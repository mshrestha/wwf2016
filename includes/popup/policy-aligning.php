                <p>The promulgation of Nepal’s new constitution in September 2015 was one of the biggest achievements of the country for the year. Several key points that are central to sustainable development, management of natural resources and environmental conservation are enshrined across various clauses of the new constitution. The promulgation of the constitution has brought in a logical conclusion to WWF’s association with one of the committees of the Constituent Assembly of Nepal for more than seven years and a new area of partnership has been opened with the parliamentary committees.  The Parliamentary Committee on Environment Protection and Agriculture and Energy has invited WWF for continuous support on contemporary policy issues related to natural resource management and environmental conservation.</p>
