                <p>A total of 17 conservation ponds were constructed in the catchments of the Indrawati and Dudhkoshi sub-basins benefitting 235 households. The conservation ponds are constructed to collect rainwater and run-off water as a storage to be used primarily during the dry seasons for vegetable farming. An additional 32 irrigation canals were maintained in the two sub-basins to provide access to water for irrigation purposes benefitting about 1,700 households in different project catchments thereby improving water availability and efficiency. The conservation ponds and irrigation canals have helped increased water availability in the project areas for the local communities to irrigate primarily rain-fed lands which were earlier parched on account of unpredictable rainfall patterns.</p>
