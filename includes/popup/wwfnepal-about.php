						<div class="animate-visible">
							<p>Since 1961, WWF has worked to conserve nature and ecological processes through a combination of actions on the ground, national and international advocacy work to establish appropriate policies, and international campaigns to highlight and demonstrate solutions to crucial environmental problems.</p>
							<p>WWF started working in Nepal from 1967 when it launched a rhino conservation program in Chitwan. To keep up with the evolving face of conservation and the environmental movement, WWF’s focus evolved from its localized efforts in conservation of single species in the 1960s/1970s, integrated conservation and development approach in the 1980s, to a new horizon of landscape level conservation encompassing national, regional and global scales of complexity in the early 2000s.</p>
							<p>WWF’s work in Nepal is focused in the Terai Arc Landscape (TAL) and Sacred Himalayan Landscape (SHL), including Koshi River Basin, and Chiwan-Annapurna Landscape (CHAL) under the USAID-funded Hariyo Ban Program. It is centered on four thematic goals – forests, wildlife, water and climate &amp; energy – and two drivers – finance and governance.The effective delivery of conservation results under the above four thematic areas are supported by crosscutting programs on policy and advocacy, curbing illegal wildlife trade, sustainable livelihoods, and communications.</p>
							<p class="">In Nepal, WWF works closely with the Ministry of Forests and Soil Conservation through the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation and Department of Forests, Ministry of Population and Environment, Ministry of Agricultural Development, Ministry of Land Reform and Management, Water and Energy Commission Secretariat and National Trust for Nature Conservation. Besides the national priority areas, WWF Nepal also works in conservation issues of regional and trans-boundary importance.</p>
