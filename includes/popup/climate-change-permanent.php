	    				<p>WWF Nepal established a series of permanent plots in forests to monitor long-term impacts of climate change. The plots are located in the Chitwan-Annapurna Landscape, reaching from near sea level in Chitwan to the Tibetan plateau in Mustang at 4,500 m. Fauna, flora and socio-economic baseline surveys have been undertaken. The plots will be monitored regularly to see the effects of advancing climate change and climate variability. In some cases, pairs of nearby plots have been established, one in an area expected to be vulnerable to climate and the other in a likely climate refugia.  Hariyo Ban Program also plans to establish a similar series of freshwater climate change monitoring plots in the Kali Gandaki/Narayani river system.</p>
