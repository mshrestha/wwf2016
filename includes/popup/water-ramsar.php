				<p>The Government of Nepal, Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation, Department of Forests and Pokhara Valley Lake Conservation Committee under the Chairmanship of the Local Development Officer, Kaski marked World Wetlands Day 2016 with a special celebration to declare nine lakes in Kaski district under the Ramsar Convention on 2 February 2016. The Lake cluster of the Pokhara valley has international importance, as it supports vulnerable, endangered and critically endangered species as well as threatened ecological communities. Many local people depend on resources from the lakes and their catchments, and electricity is generated through hydropower. The cluster is the 10th Ramsar Site to be declared in Nepal.</p>
