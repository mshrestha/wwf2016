	    				<p>A relief fund of USD 20,000 was instituted in TAL for local communities to address cases of human-wildlife conflict and provide relief for about 50 households who suffered damages to homes and crops by wildlife such as wild elephants. A new initiative introduced predator-resistant pens to about 160 local households whereby not a single case of livestock depredation was reported. In SHL, stone wall and electric fences helped protect about 60 households from crop depredation thereby helping secure local livelihoods. Crop and livestock depredation by wild animals is one of the primary reasons for human-wildlife conflict in both the mountain and Terai communities.</p>
