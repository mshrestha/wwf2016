				<p>In the Indrawati and Dudhkoshi sub-basins, a total of 41 spring sources were conserved to improve the water availability for drinking purposes for 645 local households as part of the IWRM project in the Koshi river basin. This was complemented by the construction of 28 water tanks to manage the drinking water benefiting more than 750 households in the two sub-basins. Rainwater harvesting systems were further installed for 110 households to improve water availability for drinking and agricultural use. The communities in Indrawati and Dudhkoshi sub-basins have been experiencing water stress for several years on account of climate change that led to the drying up of traditional water sources. Interventions such as this help protect water sources at source with the participation of local communities. </p>
