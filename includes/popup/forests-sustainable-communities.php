                <p>WWF Nepal launched the Sustainable Communities Initiative in Thulo Syafru in the buffer zone of Langtang National Park as an innovative approach to motivate community stewardship in conservation. This approach uses a package of interventions that rests on three pillars of sustainability: environmental, economic and social. In Thulo Syafru, a baseline survey was completed to serve as a basis to measure future results. Community level interventions were also initiated in the areas of sustainable forest and grassland management, alternate energy, micro-credit mechanisms for livelihoods activities, and health and sanitation. The Sustainable Communities Initiative was initiated from Amaltari in the buffer zone of Chitwan National Park in 2014.</p>
