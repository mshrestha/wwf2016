	    				<p>WWF Nepal launched the Sustainable Communities Initiative in ThuloSyafru in the buffer zone of Langtang National Park as an innovative approach to motivate community stewardship in conservation. This approach uses a package of interventions that rests on three pillars of sustainability: environmental, economic and social. In ThuloSyafru, a baseline survey was completed to serve as a basis to measure future results. Community level interventions were also initiated in the areas of sustainable forest and grassland management, alternate energy, micro-credit mechanisms for livelihoods activities, and health and sanitation. A total of XYZ households have benefitted from these preliminary interventions. The Sustainable Communities Initiative was initiated from Amaltari in the buffer zone of Chitwan National Park in 2013.</p>
