                        <p>The USAID-funded Hariyo Ban Program supported the government to establish a new landscape in the Gandaki River basin – the Chitwan-Annapurna Landscape (CHAL). CHAL stretches from the dry, high-altitude area of upper Mustang and the 8,000m high Himalayan range, down through the mid-hills to the low-lying Terai. CHAL has huge conservation importance, including snow leopard and red panda populations. Many of the 4.6 million human inhabitants are dependent on subsistence farming and forest products. The landscape’s economic activities include agriculture, tourism and hydropower. Major biodiversity threats include overharvesting of forests, uncontrolled fire, and poorly designed infrastructure development. Climate change exacerbates many threats. The new CHAL strategy will tackle these threats over the next ten years, taking an integrated river basin approach.</p>	    				

                        <div class="h1">TAL Nepal Strategy and Action Plan (2015-2025) endorsed</div>
                        <p>The TAL Nepal Strategy and Action Plan (2015-2025) was endorsed by the government of Nepal to guide the implementation of the TAL vision for the next ten-year period. WWF Nepal provided technical support for the preparation of the strategy and action plan. The new plan included an extension of about 4,518km2 area of important climate refugia in the northern part of TAL. Its precursor, the TAL Strategic Plan and Implementation Plan (2004-14), had identified thematic areas and major interventions, and a business plan for the conservation of the landscape and sustainable livelihoods of local communities. The government’s Ministry of Forests and Soil Conservation and WWF Nepal are jointly implementing two projects – Corridors and Bottlenecks Restoration Project and Protected Area and Buffer Zone Support Project – based on the strategic direction of these seminal documents.</p>
