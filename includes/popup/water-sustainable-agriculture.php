	    				<p>Together with improving water availability for irrigation purposes, a key focus of the IWRM project is on providing facilities and building capacity of local communities with regard to climate-smart and sustainable agriculture. In the Indrawatiand Dudhkoshi sub-basins, a total of 238 poly-houses were constructed for local households primarily for growing vegetables. Without poly-houses, local people had had to forego harvests in the past on account of unpredictable weather patterns that damaged crops. The project also organized farmersâ€™ schools on integrated pest management with the objective of reducingthe use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and promoting organic farming. These interventions have helped promote sustainable agriculture and enhancedthe livelihoods of local communities in the sub-basins.</p>
