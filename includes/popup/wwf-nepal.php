	    				<div class="animate-visible"><p>Since 1961, WWF has worked to conserve nature and ecological processes through a combination of actions on the ground, national and international advocacy work to establish appropriate policies, and international campaigns to highlight and demonstrate solutions to crucial environmental problems.</p>
                        <p>WWF started working in Nepal from 1967 when it launched a rhino conservation program in Chitwan. To keep up with the evolving face of conservation and the environmental movement, WWF’s focus evolved from its localized efforts in conservation of single species in the 1960s/1970s, integrated conservation and development approach in the 1980s, to a new horizon of landscape level conservation encompassing national, regional and global scales of complexity in the early 2000s.</p>
                        <p>WWF’s work in Nepal is focused in the Terai Arc Landscape (TAL) and Sacred Himalayan Landscape (SHL), including Koshi River Basin, and Chiwan-Annapurna Landscape (CHAL) under the USAID-funded Hariyo Ban Program. It is centered on four thematic goals – forests, wildlife, water and climate &amp; energy – and two drivers – finance and governance.The effective delivery of conservation results under the above four thematic areas are supported by crosscutting programs on policy and advocacy, curbing illegal wildlife trade, sustainable livelihoods, and communications.</p>
                        <p>In Nepal, WWF works closely with the Ministry of Forests and Soil Conservation through the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation and Department of Forests, Ministry of Population and Environment, Ministry of Agricultural Development, Ministry of Land Reform and Management, Water and Energy Commission Secretariat and National Trust for Nature Conservation. Besides the national priority areas, WWF Nepal also works in conservation issues of regional and trans-boundary importance.</p>

                        <p>WWF Nepal’s mission is to stop the degradation of Nepal’s natural environment, and to build a future in which people live in harmony with nature, by conserving biological diversity, ensuring sustainable use of renewable resources, reducing pollution and wasteful consumption, and addressing sustainable livelihoods.</p>

                        <p>By 2015 WWF Nepal shall conserve at least 3 priority landscapes within the Global 200 Ecoregions by reducing threats to species, habitat and ecological processes, and improving the livelihoods of local people</p>

                        <!-- REGIONAL PROGRAMS -->
                        <h1 class="uppercase">REGIONAL PROGRAMS</h1>
                        <div class="h1">Living Himalayas Initiative</div>
                        <p>WWF’s work in Nepal is part of Living Himalayas – WWF’s global initiative, which aims to bring the three governments of Bhutan, India and Nepal together to effectively manage and conserve the natural resources in the face of climate change for the sake of their unique people, their exceptional wildlife and their breath-taking environment. Combining connectivity and regional solutions, the initiative views the eco-region as a single unit and not a series of fragmented landscapes in separate countries. Wildlife trade, landscape management and development issues will be treated regionally, bringing people, government and industry together in the three countries and developing plans that straddle borders and landscapes.</p>

                        <div class="h1">Tigers Alive Initiative</div>
                        <p>The tiger is iconic of Asia’s natural heritage and ecological integrity, and has wide cultural esteem. Unfortunately, due to extensive habitat loss and intensive poaching for their body parts, tiger populations across the range have shrunk alarmingly over the past five decades. Today tigers occupy a mere 7% of their historic range. WWF, recognizing that a wider paradigm shift is required if Asia’s top predator is to survive the next decade and beyond, is working to protect the tiger through its ambitious network-wide Tigers Alive Initiative (TAI). The TAI team proposes a bold plan to galvanize political will and take action to double the number of wild tigers by the year 2022, focusing on 13 tiger landscapes in the 13 tiger range countries. The Government of Nepal has shown exceptional commitment to TX2 and is working with WWF Nepal and its conservation partners to achieve the same.</p>

                        <div class="h1">Asian Rhino and Elephant Action Strategy</div>
                        <p>Asian elephants and all four Asian rhino species are amongst the most endangered large mammals in the world and their numbers are falling at some of the critical biodiversity sites. WWF is doing its best to halt this trend and initiated a suite of conservation activities for these important species under a comprehensive program called AREAS (Asian Rhino and Elephant Action Strategy) and based the regional HQ in WWF Nepal Program since the year 2000. The overall objective is that the WWF AREAS program is instrumental in achieving conservation results through interventions by WWF and interventions of partner organizations (governments, NGOs, and other stakeholders) so that Asian elephant and rhino populations are viable in adequate habitats in 2020. It will do so by enhancing institutional capacity of WWF and partners through technical and policy support to contribute to the survival of viable populations of Asian elephants, greater one-horned, Sumatran and Javan rhinos in the wild. The program will also monitor at the regional level to measure the impact of WWF investments for the conservation of these four species of Asian pachyderms. Nepal aims to establish two viable rhino populations in Chitwan and Western Complexes.</p>
